\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
If you would like to thank somebody for given support, this is the right place to do so. Generally, trying to  fit everything in a single page is a good idea. If you want, you can ask your supervisor if you can move this section right before the Table of Contents, after the Abstract/Sommario.
